# Just In Time - SWEN222 Group Project Game

A player moves throughout a two-dimensional block world on a scooter and at the press of a button, the player can reverse gravity and move along the ceiling. The objective of the game is for the player to race from their home to Victoria University in order to hand in an assignment and collect items and bonuses along the way, all whilst avoiding enemies. The game is time based and the objective is to reach the university before the assignment deadline. There will be three levels within the game, all with different layouts relating to locations around Wellington, as well as different items, bonuses, and enemies. The scooter has a battery level which slowly drains, so therefore the player must collect batteries as they move in order to reach the end of the level. The world will scroll from side to side depending on the direction the player is moving in. The player will be able to reach checkpoints within the game which will save their progress. The player will be able to reload the game from these checkpoints.
