We have completed our game to what we believe is a very high standard. We spent a lot of time 
throughout the improvement phase making graphical and performance improvements, as well as 
adding a large amount of test cases. We increased our testing coverage from around 30% to 70% 
of the entire code base. There were a number of bugs that were found during this phase as well 
mainly to do with interactions between the player and objects/NPCs within the game. These were 
fixed through the improvement phase. Saving and loading had been working prior to this 
development phase, but there were a number of issues with it, causing some serious issues when 
loading a game back in. We managed to work as a group to test the library and discover the root 
cause of the issue and fixed this also.

Throughout this phase, we met almost every day as a group for a few hours in order to share ideas 
and collaborate on the final connections between the libraries in order to achieve the intended 
result. We also made a large number of graphical changes in this phase, providing new level designs 
and animated features within the game in order to make the game look more appealing and make some 
of the interactions with NPCs and other objects more clear.
