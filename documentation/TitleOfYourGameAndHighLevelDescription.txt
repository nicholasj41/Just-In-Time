Title:

Just In Time


Description:

A player moves throughout a two-dimensional block world on a scooter and at the press
of a button, the player can reverse gravity and move along the ceiling. The objective
of the game is for the player to race from their home to Victoria University in order
to hand in an assignment and collect items and bonuses along the way, all whilst
avoiding enemies. The game is time based and the objective is to reach the university
before the assignment deadline. There will be three levels within the game, all with
different layouts relating to locations around Wellington, as well as different items,
bonuses, and enemies. The scooter has a battery level which slowly drains, so therefore
the player must collect batteries as they move in order to reach the end of the level.
The world will scroll from side to side depending on the direction the player is moving
in. The player will be able to reach checkpoints within the game which will save their
progress. The player will be able to reload the game from these checkpoints.
