We plan to use the following libraries as part of our project:

Java Utilities:
	Standard Java library to perform more advanced functions. Will be used primarily for collections 
	and object management.

JavaX Swing:
	Will provide the window management for the game and control the game menu. 
	
JavaX Sound:
	Game sounds will be created using this library.

Java AWT:
	Much of the graphics will be controlled using the AWT library.
	
Java IO: 
	Input and output 
	
Java Net URL:
	Will allow us to easily access the resources folder from our game so that we can load images, 
	sounds and other resources.
	
Graphics:
	Will provide the basis of the graphical representation of the game.
	
Graphics2D:
	Extends the Graphics library
	
JUnit 4:
	Will allow us to test the program and ensure that all features and functions work as expected.

As we develop the game further, we will most likely add more libraries in order to accommodate for 
the functionality we desire.
