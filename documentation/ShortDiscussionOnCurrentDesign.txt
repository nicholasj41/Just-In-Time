	At this point we have most of the libraries communicating with each other through 
	APIs, connecting interfaces and the model-view-controller (MVC). The GUI and menu 
	works as expected and has been tested thoroughly. The level generation and the other 
	parts of the level library have been tested to achieve 100% code coverage. Most of 
	the artwork has been completed as well, and at the time of writing this, our main 
	focus is on connecting the player, level and physics libraries together so that the 
	game is actually playable. At the same time as the API between these libraries is 
	being built, we are also focusing on getting the side scrolling of the GUI window 
	working correctly. After this we plan to add in bonuses and NPCs to the game and 
	connect up the save/load library through an API with the savable interface within 
	the library.
	
	We are also part way through the development of our strict MVC design while connecting 
	the libraries together. We are still writing new test cases in JUnit in order to make 
	sure that not only the libraries work correctly in isolation (unit testing) but also when 
	they are connected together (integration testing).
