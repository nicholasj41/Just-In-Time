We experienced a few difficulties when putting the libraries together, mainly in regards to the 
isolated testing. Once example is that we initially decided on creating a save/load library, but 
this proved to be difficult to implement as a stand-alone library that could be tested in isolation 
due to the fact that we were unable to test how it would save a level and the player's position 
within that level without being about to make reference to the level. 

Much of the development and testing of the other libraries went mostly to plan and we were able to 
test these in isolation. Interactions/collisions between players and objects were able to be 
developed and tested alone without many issue because they connected via a similar interface and 
therefore as long as we maintain the same interface, we can be confident that the interactions will 
work correctly. 

Level generation changed slightly from being predefined levels to a semi-random level generation 
which added more depth to the game, and with the way we developed it, we were able to adjust the 
size and length as well as the difficulty of the game by increasing the randomness and frequency 
of randomness in the level generation.

Ensuring the physics of the change in gravity worked as expected was also easier than expected as 
we were able to simply move a generic object up and down in an array of null spaces, and as soon as 
it encountered a not null space, we could define this as being a solid block and stop the movement.

Creating the GUI including a menu and scrolling interface was fairly easy as it mainly required 
knowledge that had been learnt throughout the first half of the trimester in SWEN222 through the 
first two assignments.
