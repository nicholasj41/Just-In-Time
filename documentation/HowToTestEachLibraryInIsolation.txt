	We discussed some of the specific of our project with Marco and understand that much of the 
	code needs to be able to be testing in isolation but interfaces and APIs are appropriate in 
	order to connect these libraries. We aim to achieve maximum code coverage and correct testing 
	of all our code.
	
	We managed to test each library in isolation are get extremely high code coverage by all 
	agreeing on the standard Java libraries that our classes would use as an API to connect via.
	For example, we agreed to use a combination of the Point2D library as well as a bounding box
	as a means of processing interactions. We could then test any Point2D object through our 
	physics classes in order to test collisions and interactions between what would become blocks 
	in the future. We used a 'savable' interface to process saving and loading which mean that we 
	could conduct our tests with any object as long as it implements the savable interface. By 
	doing so, we were able to test the class in isolation.
